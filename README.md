# Project

This project is meant to learn the basics of VueJS

## Summary

Throughout the course I learned about:

- How to mount a Vue app to a div to use Vue
- How to display data from VueJS into the HTML
- What are Vue directives like v-bind, v-if, etc... which to update the html content via Vue
- How to handle events
- How to bind classes and to apply style html elements
- How to split the structure of the website into components which let us re-use the component how many times we want and is much more readable (no huge file with everything within it)
- I also learned how to bind value from html to vue using v-model, usually used when user input is needed (forms)
